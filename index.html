      Using example from Paper.js
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Wavy Wave
    </h2>

    <p>
      I modified Future Splash example from paper.js website provided into wavy wave form on my photograph of the beach.<br>
      At first, I changed the color of the fill to ocean blue to be looked like the ocean.<br>
      Then, I adjust the values such as timestep and mass to give heavier wave feeling than the example that paper.js provided.<br>
      After adjustments, it does not show anymore of the shallow mood of the wavy shapes.<br>
      In addition, I added the background image which was a bit of challenge to figure it out.<br>
      Also, when the space bar key is pushed, the wave color will change for brighter blue.<br>
      <br>
      I wanted to use this paper.js canvas as moody and also the user can play with wave.<br>
      Thus, I made the ocean wave flowing over my photograph of the beach with mirror of its reflection.<br>
